    "Q1. If you have any, what are your choices for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Matplotlib provides a convenient method called subplots for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph. Subplots mean a group of smaller axes (where each axis is a plot) that can exist together within a single figure."
