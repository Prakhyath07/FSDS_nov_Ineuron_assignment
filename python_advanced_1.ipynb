    "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",

For each user, we will need to store a number of properties, such as their username, email adress, password, etc. Since these properties will be the same for every user, we can efficiently use a class to predefine what should and can be stored regarding each user.\n",

The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object."
