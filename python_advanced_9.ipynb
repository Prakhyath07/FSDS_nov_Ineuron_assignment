    "\n",
    "When a file is opened in text mode, reading its data automatically decodes its content (as per the platform default or as per provided encoding), and returns it as a str; writing operation takes a str, and automatically encodes it before transferring to the file. Text mode files also support universal end-of-line translation, and encoding specification arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is opened in binary mode by adding a b to the mode string argument in the open() call, reading its data does not decode it in any way, and simply returns its content raw and unchanged, as a bytes object; writing takes a bytes object and transfers it to the file unchanged. Binary-mode files also accept a bytearray object for the content to be written to the file.\n",
