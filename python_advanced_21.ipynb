    "\n",
    "Probability distribution is a function that is used to give the probability of all the possible values that a random variable can take. A discrete probability distribution can be described by a probability distribution function and a probability mass function. Similarly, a probability distribution function and a probability density function are used to describe a continuous probability distribution. Binomial, Bernoulli, normal, and geometric distributions are examples of probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable can be described as a variable that can take on the possible values of an outcome of an experiment. There can be two types of random variables, namely, discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete random variable can be defined as a variable that can take a countable distinct value like 0, 1, 2, 3...\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous random variable can be defined as a variable that can take on infinitely many values. As the probability that a continuous random variable will take on an exact value is 0 hence, we cannot use the probability mass function (pmf) to describe such a distribution. We use the probability density function in place of the pmf.\n",
